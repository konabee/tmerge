This code is written to explain how to use tmerge() function in R to split episodes by time-varying covariates in survival analysis. In this example, the event of interest is the occurence of intimate partner violence (IPV). The duration is from the start of the relationship until the occurence of IPV or censorship. This snippet of code does not elaborate on how to create a survival object, but it is a straight forward task using the survival package, once the data is prepared.
